### Technologies
This app was developed with Next and the Github API. I used phosphor for some icons, axios for http-requests, Styled-Components for styles and Typescript as language!

It consists of a portfolio for all devs, backend, frontend and anyone who needs portfolio for their projects on Github!

### First of all:
- You needs to have a code editor to edit the code!
- Have [Github](https://github.com);
- Have some repos.

### Get Started
Clone the repo
Run to install all dependences: 
```sh
npm install
or
yarn
```
Go to the api.ts file and change the user to your user

Run this to see the development project:
```sh
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```

Open in your browser the url http://localhost:3000 and check if your information is corrects!

After all that, go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) or your favorite app deployment platform and deploy!
